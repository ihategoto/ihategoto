- 👋 Hi, I’m Claudio D'Emilio, a physics student at "La Sapienza" in Rome.
- 👀 I’m interested in everything that has math in it, but I also enjoy literature and arts.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use computers to investigate physical systems. In particular, I'm interested in complex systems and ergodic theory.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on every project from which I can learn something. 
- 📫 You can reach me at my email: cdemilio80@gmail.com
